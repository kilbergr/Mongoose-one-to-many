# Mongoose-one-to-many
##Mongo Associations Assignment

For this assignment you will need to combine your knowledge of models, and associations to build a zoo application!

###Requirements

Your application should have two models, zoo and animal. A zoo has many animals and an animal belongs to a zoo.

##Your zoo model should have a:

name
location
reference to animals
Your animal model should have a/an:

name
species
age
photo (this should be an url)
reference to a zoo
Getting started (START FROM SCRATCH)

Create an app.js, run npm init and install the required dependencies for your application.
Start working on your Zoo and Animal model and use an index.js to bundle these models together
Build your routes - THESE MUST BE RESTful. Remember that your routes will have animals nested inside of zoos.
Start working on your views
Build full CRUD for your Zoo resource and then move onto Animals (this will be more difficult)
Ensure that when a zoo is deleted, all of the animals that belong to it are deleted as well. This will involve using a pre 'remove' hook
###Bonus

Think about how you can refactor your nested routes. Do you really need /zoo/:zoo_id in all of your animals routes, or we can we remove it from some of them?

Style your application! Feel free to include bootstrap/bootswatch and make your app look great.
